# cloud-cost-reporter

Tracker and reporting tool for Azure and AWS costs.

## Overview

A proof of concept application for tracking Azure and AWS costs and usage. Built in Ruby (no framework), with a basic SQLite database.

## Installation

This application requires Ruby (2.5.1) and a recent version of Bundler (2.1.4).

After downloading the source code (via git or other means), the gems need to be installed using bundler:

```
cd /path/to/source
bundle install
```

To create the local database, run `db/setup.rb`.

## Configuration

### AWS 

On AWS, projects can be tracked on an account or project tag level. For tracking by project tag, ensure that all desired resources are given a tag with the key `project` and a value of what you have named the project. 

These tags should be added at the point a resource is created. If adding tags to instances in the AWS online console, these tags will also be applied to their associated storage. However, if creating instances via CloudFormation, these must be tagged explictly (see https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudformation-instance-tag-root-volume/). It is recommended that these project tags are added even if the intention is to track by account number, as this will allow for greater flexibility and accuracy if a second project is later added to the same account.

This application includes in its breakdown details of instances specifically used as compute nodes. For this to be measured accurately, the appropriate instances should have a tag added with the key `compute` and the value `true`. Again, these should be added at the point of creation.

The project and compute tags must also be activated in the Billing console (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/activating-tags.html).

This application makes use of a number of AWS sdks, which require a valid `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key`. This should relate to a user with access to: Billing and Cost Management, Cost Explorer API, EC2 API and Pricing API.

### Azure

In this application, Azure projects are assumed to be confined to a single Azure resource group (to be specified at project creation). In addition, it is required that compute nodes be given the `"type" => "compute"` tag on the Azure platform.

The point at which tags are added does not affect the data pulled from the Azure API. As long as the resources that you want to analyse have the tag, the detail objects associated with that resource will be queried.

In order to run the application, an app and service principal must be created in Azure Active Directory (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal for more details). The app must have at least `Reader` level permissions given to it in the subscription you wish to use it in, via the `Access control (IAM)` blade.

Azure projects require the following details to be obtained prior to project creation:

- Directory (tenant) ID
- Client (application) ID
- Client secret
- Subscription ID
- Resource group name

The first three can be obtained via the app you created in Azure Active Directory. The subscription ID is located in the overview for the subscription containing the project; as is the resource group name in the overview for the resource group.

### Slack

The application includes the option to send results to slack, specifying a specific channel for each project. To use this function, a slack bot (https://slack.com/apps/A0F7YS25R-bots) must be created. The bot's API Token should then be used to set an environment variable:

`SLACK_TOKEN=yourtoken ruby -e 'p ENV["SLACK_TOKEN"]'`

This bot must be invited to each project's chosen slack channel.

### Adding projects

A `Project` object should be created for each project you wish to track. These can be created by running `ruby manage_projects.rb` and following the prompts in the command line. This file can also be used to update existing projects. Projects should not be deleted, but instead their 'end_date' set to mark them as inactive.

### Adding customer friendly instance type names

An 'InstanceMapping' object can be created for adding a customer friendly name (e.g. "Compute (Large)"") for an AWS or Azure instance type (e.g. "c5.xlarge" or "Standard_F4s_v2"). These can be created by running `ruby manage_instance_mappings.rb` and following the prompts in the command line. This file can also be used to update or delete existing mappings. Customer friendly names are currently used for describing compute nodes in weekly reports. If no mapping is found for that instance type, 'Compute (other)' is used.

### Currency and compute unit conversion

Base compute units are calculated as 10 * the GBP cost. For costs received in USD (i.e. from AWS), the default exchange rate of $1 = Â£0.77 is used. This can be overriden using an environment variable, replacing 0.77 with the desired, more up to date value:

 `USD_GBP_CONVERSION=new_value ruby -e 'p ENV["USD_GBP_CONVERSION"]'`

# Operation

The application includes functionality for generating both daily and weekly reports of cloud usage and cost data. The obtained data is saved in the database and, unless specified, queries where an existing report exists will use stored data instead of making fresh sdk/api calls.

Daily reports can be generated using `ruby daily_reports.rb`. If run without any arguments, this will iterate over all Projects in the database and retrieve data for 2 days ago (as cost & usage data takes 2 days to update). The results will be printed to the terminal and posted to the chosen slack channel(s).

Weekly reports can similarly be generated using `ruby weekly_reports.rb`. If run without any arguments, this will iterate over all Projects in the database and retrieve data for the month so far, including estimating costs for the rest of the month. The results will be printed to the terminal and posted to the chosen slack channel(s). Weekly reports use the specified date (2 days ago by default) for historical cost data, and will use either use the specified date's instance information, or today's if generating the 'latest' report.

Both of these files also take up to 6 arguments:

1: project name or 'all'\
2: a specific date or 'latest'. All dates must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD

The following are optional and unordered (but must be at least the third argument):

3: 'slack' will post the results to the chosen slack channel(s)\
4: 'text' will print out the results. If no output method is specified (neither 'text' or 'slack'), results will be posted to slack and printed on the terminal\
5: 'rerun' will ignore cached reports and regenerate them with fresh sdk/ api calls\
6: 'verbose' will expand any brief Azure errors to include the full HTTP response from the Azure API instead of just the error code.


## Examples

To get all projects' reports with cost data from two days ago, with both slack and text output, using cached data if present:

`ruby daily_reports.rb` or `ruby daily_reports.rb all latest`

`ruby weekly_reports.rb` or `ruby weekly_reports.rb all latest`

To get a report for a specific project, with cost data from two days ago, with only text output and using cached data if present:

`ruby daily_reports.rb projectName latest text`

`ruby weekly_reports.rb projectName latest text`

To get a report for a specific project, with cost data from two days ago, with only slack output and using cached data if present:

`ruby daily_reports.rb projectName latest slack`

`ruby weekly_reports.rb projectName latest slack`

To get a report for a specific project for a specific date, with both slack and text output and using cached data if present

`ruby daily_reports.rb projectName 2020-09-20 slack text`

`ruby weekly_reports.rb projectName 2020-09-20 slack text`

To get all projects' reports for a specific day, with only text output and fresh cost and usage queries

`ruby daily_reports.rb all 2020-09-20 text rerun`

`ruby weekly_reports.rb all 2020-09-20 text rerun`


### Recording Azure Pricing

For the weekly report, future costs are estimated based on the active compute nodes and their daily costs, using pricing from AWS and Azure respectively. For Azure, the Ratecard api used here returns a very large list of prices, with extremely limited serverside filtering available. To prevent excessive waits for this request each time `weekly_reports.rb` is run, this price list is saved to a text file, `azure_prices.txt`. This includes a timestamp, and when generating Azure weekly reports, if less than a day old, the data is read directly from the file rather than making another api request.

You can also run `ruby get_latest_azure_prices.rb`, which will use an existing Azure project (which provides the required credentials for the API) to run this update to the prices on command. By setting up a cronjob to run this separately from the main files (for example, at the start of each day), wait times for generating Azure weekly reports can be dramatically reduced.
